# df-mqtt

df-mqtt is an MQTT client for DreamFactory, allowing DreamFactory to interact with MQTT-based message brokers. It depends upon the [Mosquitto-PHP](https://github.com/mgdm/Mosquitto-PHP) package, which in turn relies upon [libmosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/).

## Requirements 

This library requires the [Mosquitto-PHP](https://github.com/mgdm/Mosquitto-PHP) extension to be installed.

    sudo pecl install Mosquitto-alpha
